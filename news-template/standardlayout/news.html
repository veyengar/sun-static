              The University’s 117th Dragon Day Parade on Friday drew in large numbers of Cornellians, community 
              members and visiting students who bonded over dance, music and celebration.
              After weeks of preparation, first-year architecture students dressed in identical black hoodies and 
              held up a massive white, transparent dragon. They chanted “oy, oy, oy” in response to repeated calls 
              of “dragon, dragon, dragon” by a captain.
              <aside class="pquote">
                  <blockquote>
                      <p>“The thing that surprises me is just the number of people that came out,” Doyle said. “I think people seem 
                          really excited. I haven’t really seen the campus come together this much before.”</p>
                  </blockquote>

              Upon arriving at the engineering quad, where a phoenix was hanging in the courtyard according to 
              security personnel, the architecture students did a dragon dance by waving the flexible pieces of the 
              dragon’s tail around in an alternating fashion.
              Yiwei Xue ’21, a first year architecture student, said she was very proud of their dragon dance.
              <br/><br/>
              The parade attracted many people, who stopped by to take pictures on the sidewalks and even joined the 
              crowd to move along with the dragon.
              <br/><br/>
              Laurel Doyle ’21 said she went to the parade because she is a freshman and was really curious about how 
              the parade would go and what the dragon would look like.
              <br/><br/>
              She said that “the [high] quality construction of the dragon and all the wild costumes people came up with”
              left memorable impressions on her and that she would “mostly likely” attend next year’s dragon day 
              celebration as well.
              Sophie Xu-Friedman ’21 said she actually saw the parade two years ago when she happened to be touring Cornell 
              on Dragon Day. Now, as a Cornell freshman, Xu-Friedman said she saw the event in a new light.
              <br/><br/>
              “It’s kind of like unity, everyone coming together to build this project together,” she said.

                Two high school juniors at Christian Brothers Academy in Syracuse, who plan to apply to the architecture program 
                at the University, happened to be visiting Cornell when they encountered the dragon parade, which they said was a 
                pleasant surprise.
                <br/><br/>
                “It’s really awesome because I have never seen [this] before … it makes me really want to come here to Cornell … 
                just love the environment, feels super comfortable to me,”  said Jimmy Xu, one of these high school students.
                <br/><br/>
                They added that they were excited about seeing the parade because it was an example of one of the many rewarding 
                learning opportunities at the architecture school. They said this motivated them to work even harder, so they 
                could be accepted to Cornell and participate in building the dragon themselves.
                Dragon Day is “a well-known and celebrated rite of spring for the first-year architecture class”, according to the
                 School of Architecture, Art and Planning’s website. However, the parade has grown beyond an exclusive ceremony 
                 for the Cornell students to serve as a get-together for the wider Ithacan community.
                Alexia Asgari ’21, a first-year architecture student who participated in creating and carrying the dragon, noticed 
                large families with elderly people and children among the crowds of students. 
                <br/><br/>

                <aside class="pquote quote-left">
                  <blockquote>
                      <p> “I was actually surprised to see how involved and excited the families in Ithaca were for this parade. I 
                        remember seeing these small children wearing dragon costumes, and it was absolutely the cutest thing I’ve 
                        ever seen.”</p>
                  </blockquote>
                </aside>

                “It is awesome to know that the work is not just for yourself to look at and be proud of, but rather for everyone 
                to enjoy,” Asgari added.

                  In 1989, four years after joining Gold’s lab, Tuerk was conducting research for his Ph.D. thesis on viral DNA. 
                  While experimenting with a type of virus that infects bacteria, Tuerk noticed that strands from the virus’s RNA 
                  had somehow bound themselves to specific proteins. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids. What Tuerk had discovered 
                  accidentally was a way to identify immense numbers of proteins at once with nucleic acids instead of antibodies, 
                  using a molecule found on both DNA and RNA called an aptamer. 
                  <br/><br/>
                  It was a momentous breakthrough. “We didn’t start dancing because we were 
                  being science-y types,” Gold said. They did, however, immediately begin drafting a patent, which Gold stayed up 
                  all night to write. The next evening, a biotech entrepreneur named David Brunel invited Gold over for 
                  Thanksgiving dinner. “I fell asleep on the floor of David’s house,” Gold said. “People were walking over me.”
                  <br/><br/>
                  Brunel later invested in SomaLogic, and Gold has put at least $20 million of his own money into the firm, made 
                  from the sale of two companies he founded previously. At his venture before SomaLogic, during the early 1990s, 
                  Gold helped develop the first F.D.A.-approved aptamer-derived medication, for macular degeneration, which had 
                  roughly $200 million in sales in its first year on the market. But even then, Gold had bigger plans for aptamers 
                  — to use them to analyze proteins on an unprecedented scale. He would glean patterns from the data that could 
                  diagnose diseases.

                  It was possible 
                  to do the same thing with antibodies, but that would require luck and patience, like trying to catalog every 
                  fish in the ocean with a net that captured only a single species at a time. And even then, in those years — right 
                  about the time when Marc Wilkins, a graduate student at Macquarie University in Australia, coined the word 
                  “proteomics” — it might have taken months for researchers to make sense of the voluminous data. Proteins are folded 
                  into intricate three-dimensional structures. Mapping one was challenging enough; mapping thousands was all but 
                  unmanageable.

            “Antibodies are used mostly to measure one protein,” Gold said. “They would never scale to what I thought 
            proteomics would have to do to make it significant in health care” — that is, generate information quickly and 
            cheaply enough to be practical for doctors to use in daily clinical practice. “I had this idea that if you measured 
            enough proteins, you’d be able to get insights into human biology that were hard to get any other way.”

            SOMAscan is the manifestation of his vision. It’s a twofold technology platform, combining machine learning with 
            a chemical process to isolate 5,000 proteins from a single drop of blood. Williams says this scan has found 
            fingerprint-like patterns for more than 50 diseases, including lung and pancreatic cancer, both notorious for their 
            dismal survival rates.
            <br/><br/>
            What these fingerprints convey can be grouped into three categories: probability (your odds of getting sick), 
            current state (you’re already sick but don’t know it) and trajectory (how soon you’ll get worse). “There are patterns 
            that do each of these jobs,” Williams told me, adding that his ultimate goal is to find all these patterns, for any 
            condition, in a single scan, and also measure whether they change in response to lifestyle improvements or medication.
            <br/><br/>
            PROTEOMICS HAS FACED something of a chicken-or-egg dilemma. Doctors won’t embrace the technology until they are 
            sure that protein screenings provide reliable results, but improving reliability is largely contingent on widespread 
            adoption. Put another way, the greater the number of patients who are tested, the more accurate the fingerprints become.

              Before it had patients whose proteins it could analyze, SomaLogic began building its disease database with biobanks, 
              which store frozen blood and tissue for research. Using specimens from these repositories — the ones at the National 
              Institutes of Health and many research hospitals are made accessible to scientists — the company began to hone its 
              machine-learning algorithm, training it to search for key protein configurations. Donors to biobanks are anonymous, 
              but their health data is not. 
              <br/><br/>
              By cross-indexing newly identified protein patterns with medical histories, researchers might find a new disease 
              fingerprint in a subset of donors who had liver cancer, for example. SomaLogic can duplicate or confirm these 
              findings by scanning different samples and using different biobanks, which the company is doing now.
